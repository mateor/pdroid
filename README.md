Automatically exported from code.google.com/p/pdroid

With the closing of Google Code, I exported this code from https://code.google.com/p/pdroid/.

Everything that is not the README was written by [**redacted**], who does not have a github account to my knowledge.
The license is GPLv3 as [**redacted**] set it in the Google Code repo.

This is the second time I have exported this code, I did it once before but I converted from svn to git by hand.
You can see that [here](https://github.com/mateor/PDroidHistory).  I also added the LICENSE file, the Google
Code exporter did not include it for some arbitrary reason.

*Update*: In early 2017, the original author contacted me and requested that I remove his name from the commits or delete the repo entirely. I preserved this as an archival project and was unwilling to simply wipe from the internet, but I also consider his name and email to be orthogonal to its value.

I have rewritten the history to credit an anonymous author and have force-pushed. I also squashed the README commits that explain that history.
